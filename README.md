Advent of code 2020 solutions
## Day 1
### Part 1
This challenge needed me to find two numbers within a list that sum to 2020 and then to multiply those numbers.

### Part 2
The 2nd part needed me to find 3 numbers this time which summed to 2020 and then to multiply them together.

## Day 2
### Part 1
This challenge gives a requirement for a string and then the string to check it against. It details the letter and the number of times it may appear in the string. I need to then check if the string follows that requirement and then return the total number of valid passwords.

### Part 2
The requirements have changed! Now for the requirements the numbers detailed show that that character must show up in either of those positions in the string, not the amount of times that character appears. Then the number of valid strings it needed to be returned once again.

## Day 3
### Part 1
The input is a 'map' which is a 2d array that consists of '#' and '.'. The '#' represents a tree while the other character represents empty space. As a pointer travels through this 2d array the amount of times a pointer lands on a tree needs to be recorded. The 2d array can be repeated horizontally forever. Input is a distance down and right to travel every iteration. 

### Part 2
Multiple distances down and right are now provided. The tree count from each one is needed and then those results multiplied is the answer.
